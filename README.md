We save more research and development costs for digital panel manufacturers, expanding our own market competitiveness. Our digital panel drivers work better than other manufacturers with strong compatibility, and we use completely independent research and development technology with source code. We don't use wacom proprietary technology. At present, several manufacturers in China are using our driving technology, and the sales volume and reputation are very good.

### Introduction to Source Code
#### windows
##### Source code contains 3 modules, with low coupling
* The gui is primarily used for user interface
* TabletDriverSerivce is primarily used to process logical business data of digital board.


* All graphics software of Wintab calls the interface of Wintab, otherwise the it will be in no pressure state, which means it cannot be used normally. We have redeveloped the relevant interface of Wintab, which can be well used with Windows LNK mode, and perfectly compatible with the graphics software in the market on Win10 and Win7 systems.
#### MacOS
* Support 10.8 systems or above. The whole driver module simulates the pressure sense of the tablet, which is perfectly compatible with all the drawing software in the market.
### The following software has been tested without any problems
#### List of Windows tests
* Adobe Photoshop
* CorelDRAW
* Corel PHOTO-PAINT
* openCanvas
* MediBang Paint Pro
* PaintToolSai
